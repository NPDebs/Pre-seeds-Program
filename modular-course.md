## THE WHY

This course is designed to democratise access to essential research skills for a diverse range of participants. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of research methods, empowering individuals from various backgrounds to engage in scientific inquiry, enhance their professional development, and contribute to the global research community. This course can serve multiple audiences, including citizen scientists, newly hired Research Software Engineers (RSEs), and other individuals seeking to familiarise themselves with the research process.
