# Research 101 Course

## THE WHY

This course is designed to democratise access to essential research skills for a diverse range of participants. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of research methods, empowering individuals from various backgrounds to engage in scientific inquiry, enhance their professional development, and contribute to the global research community. This course can serve multiple audiences, including citizen scientists, newly hired Research Software Engineers (RSEs), and other individuals seeking to familiarise themselves with the research process.

This initiative is deeply inspired by the capacity building work being done by [OLS](http://we-are-ols.org/), through their flagship programs like [Open Seeds](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) and [Nebula](https://we-are-ols.org/nebula).

## Course Description

This course provides an opportunity for participants to establish and/or advance their understanding of research. Designed for beginners, it covers fundamentals of research — a basic introduction to the language of research, the scientific method, quantitative and qualitative data collection, and ethical considerations. Further on, the course dives into other aspects of research, such as literature review, hypothesis testing and licensing. The participants will be expected to use their knowledge to begin critical review of literature relevant to their field or interests.

The course is designed to be accessible and inclusive, encouraging participation from underrepresented groups and individuals at various career stages.

## Use cases
**1. Undergraduate and Graduate Students:**
**Objective:** Provide students with a solid grounding in research methodologies before engaging in academic projects.

This contributes to solving the problem of insufficient research training in early academic stages. The benefits include: preparing students for thesis work, internships, and future research roles.

**2. Citizen Science:**
**Objective:** Empower everyday individuals to contribute to scientific research projects.

This bridges the gap caused by lack of accessible resources for non-scientists, which prevents them from engaging in meaningful research.

It can potentially enhance public understanding of science, improve community engagement, and crowdsource valuable data for large-scale studies.

**3. Newly Hired Research Software Engineers (RSEs):**
**Objective:** Equip new RSEs with foundational research skills during the first few months on the job.

This reduces the gap between technical expertise and research acumen.

The course can significantly accelerate onboarding, enhance collaboration with research teams, and improve project outcomes.

**4. Professional Development for Educators:**
**Objective:** To provide a comprehensive research training program that supports the professional growth of individuals in various fields, enabling them to integrate research skills into their work and advance their careers.

Target audience ranges from educators and health professionals to cooperate employees, entrepreneurs and business leaders.

The course addresses skill gaps, enhances career prospects, supports informed decision-making, and promotes innovation. The benefit is that it equips professionals with research skills, improves industry practices, fosters data-driven strategies, and encourages continuous improvement and innovation across various fields.

The overarching goal is to improve the quality of research education, encourage innovation in teaching, and support lifelong learning.
