## Phase 1: Conceptualisation and Planning
The goals during this phase include:
- Define module scopes, objectives, and potential collaborators.
- Conduct a preliminary investigation, including research into existing similar programs and identifying gaps.
- Write contributor guidelines to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.
- Develop a roadmap outlining key milestones, timelines, and dependencies.
- Create an open canvas to visualise project needs, potential barriers, and solutions.
- Describe personas to represent target participants and contributors, considering their goals, challenges, and motivations.
- Identify necessary tools, platforms, and resources for collaborative curriculum development.
- Reach out to and connect with individuals who share a similar passion for developing or using Open Educational Resources.

## Phase 2: Collaborative Lesson Development Training

- Pilot: Host an online workshop targeting 30 participants from underrepresented communities.

- Metrics: Success measured through sign-ups, feedback surveys, and module completion rates.

## Phase 4: Expanding Reach & Community Building
- Build a community of 10-15 contributors to help with curriculum development and facilitation.

- Collaborators will come from The Carpentries, other open-source communities, and RSE groups.

- Metrics: Track contributions to open-source materials as a measure of community engagement.

## Phase 5: Long-term Impact & Evaluation
- Conduct a final impact survey to evaluate the effectiveness of the course in improving research software practices within underrepresented communities.

- Refine and scale Research 101 based on feedback, aiming for global reach beyond the Fellowship.

- Final report on participant feedback and course outcomes.
