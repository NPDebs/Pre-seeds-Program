# Pre-Openseeds Research Training Program

Welcome! This repo houses a vision of making the research landscape more equitable and diverse - a “Research 101” course, undergoing development. This project aims to provide accessible and flexible research training for diverse audiences, including aspiring researchers, citizen scientists, professionals, and more.

## Project Overview

The Pre-Openseeds program is in the early stages of development, and is evolving as it grows.

It started as a beginner course designed to equip **aspiring researchers** with the foundational knowledge, skills and tools to embark on their journey. Gradually, it has morphed from the initial concept of a cohort-based training program to a modular course structure. This approach allows for greater flexibility and inclusivity, catering to different learning needs and backgrounds.

### Key Features

1. **Modular structure**: The course is divided into standalone modules, each covering a specific aspect of research. This allows learners to choose modules that best fit their needs and interests.
   
2. **Diverse use cases**:
   - **Cohort-based training**: Aimed at aspiring researchers or individuals early in their research careers. The course can be delivered in a structure similar to [Open Seeds](we-are-ols.org/openseeds) or [Nebula](we-are-ols.org/nebula).
   - **Citizen Science**: Empowering everyday individuals to engage in scientific research.
   - **Professional development**: Enhancing research skills for various professional fields.
   - **Research Software Engineers (RSEs)**: Providing foundational knowledge of research for new hires, with the aim of acclimatising them to the new work environment.
   - **Other use cases**: Open to additional applications as the program evolves.
