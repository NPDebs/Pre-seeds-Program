# Pre-Openseeds Research Training Program

Welcome! This repo houses a vision of making the research landscape more equitable and diverse - a “Research 101” course, undergoing development. This project aims to provide accessible and flexible research training for diverse audiences, including aspiring researchers, citizen scientists, professionals, and more.

## Project Overview

The Pre-Openseeds program is in the early stages of development, and is evolving as it grows.

It started as a beginner course designed to equip **aspiring researchers** with the foundational knowledge, skills and tools to embark on their journey. Gradually, it has morphed from the initial concept of a cohort-based training program to a modular course structure. This approach allows for greater flexibility and inclusivity, catering to different learning needs and backgrounds.
